# SSO Auth

## Intro

The module provides a common authentication platform (compliant with OAuth 2.0/Open ID Connect Protocol) for all student apps (web, mobile).

### What is SSO ?

SSO (Single Sign On) Its just a fancy way of saying, combine all apps login screen into one. With SSO, a user only has to enter their login credentials (username, password/OTP, etc.) one time on a single page to access all of their applications.

### What is OAuth / OIDC ?

OAuth (OpenAuth) is an open standard for authorization. OAuth works over HTTPS and authorizes devices, APIs, servers, and applications with access tokens rather than credentials.

OIDC (Open ID Connect) is a newer standard that extends OAuth, adding support for authentication. It doesnâ€™t change any of the OAuth behaviors

> Authorization is all about finding out who is allowed to access certain data and functionality. Authentication is all about logging in.
