# API Services

This folder contains apis to be used by webops/mobops team

We have chosen to go with `rpc` architecture for our apis because we wanted a simple architecture that enables us to do update structure as needed (this is helpful when we are just starting out and experimenting with the structure)

But in future if you wish to move to more stricter architecture like `rest ` or `graphql` or `trpc`, create a new directory in this folder.
